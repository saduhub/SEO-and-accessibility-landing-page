## Description

The motivation behind this project was to practice an On-the-job ticket/feature request challenge. Starter code was given to me and I was supposed to refactor it to meet a User Story. Additionaly, this challenge allowed me to practice Git flow. I also reviewed Version control, and cemented my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
